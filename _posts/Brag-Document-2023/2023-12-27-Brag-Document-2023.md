description: My first full lesson

Hi folks and future myself. This is how I have been busy during the latter half of 2023.

This year was filled with a lot of learning, a lot of failing and a lot of fun.

## June 2023 - July 2023

> I learnt basic Web Development with ReactJS framework. Completed the [Web Dev Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Angela Yu and it has been nothing but fun. I spent my June and July on ReactJS. The course was by no means complete at least until June 2023. Particularly, for ReactJS it was only `useState()` and `useEffect()` only. Yet, these were crucial in my development as a Web Developer. She teaches you how to think. And that's what I found awesome about this course. After this, I browsed through YouTube and found this channel that completely shifted my learning pace. [Codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution). Can't recommend enough. Even now more than ever. This is among those rare channels that actually has tests and not just for name sake.
