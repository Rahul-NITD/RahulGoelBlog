description: My first full lesson

Hi folks and future myself. This is how I have been busy during the latter half of 2023.

This year was filled with a lot of learning, a lot of failing and a lot of fun.

## June 2023 - July 2023

> I learnt basic Web Development with ReactJS framework. Completed the [Web Dev Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Angela Yu and it has been nothing but fun. I spent my June and July on ReactJS. The course was by no means complete at least until June 2023. Particularly, for ReactJS it was only `useState()` and `useEffect()` only. Yet, these were crucial in my development as a Web Developer. She teaches you how to think. And that's what I found awesome about this course. After this, I browsed through YouTube and found this channel that completely shifted my learning pace. [Codebasics](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution). Can't recommend enough. Even now more than ever. This is among those rare channels that actually has tests and not just for name sake. 

## August 2023
> I enrolled for the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning minor degree at my college and despite having a good teacher, we still didn't study much. But that did spark some interest in Machine Learning and I began learning some stuff on my own. This was also the time I began preapring for summer internships. so August was basically juggling between ML/AI and my worst enemy. D f..in S f..in A. People and recruiters combined seem crazy for DSA. So I kept myself busy there.
